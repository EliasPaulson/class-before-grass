# Elias -- Assignment 1

### What happens when you open a website?
 
When you open a website, a number of things are happening very quickly. First, a conversation is had between your computer and the host computer (the server). This process is called **HTTP**, or HyperText Transfer Protocol. Basically, it is a system wherein two computers can communicate and share webpages. Utilizing the same analogy as the article, it is like asking someone to pass a particular dish at the dinner table:

  - Grandpa: *Hey, Elias. I noticed you have not tried any of this delicious Lutefisk, can I pass you some?*
  - Elias: (feigning surprise and interest) *Oh, have I not taken any? Sure, I would love some."*
  - Grandpa: (passes Lutefusk)
  - Elias: (*gulps, regrettably accepts plate with gelatinous fish substance on it)

The second thing that happens is an exchange of content, i.e. text, photographs and structure. This is delineated by a universally understood system called **HTML**, or HyperText Markup Language. Continuing the analogy of the dinner table, **HTML** could be where I choose to place the Lutefisk on my plate after it has been passed to me. The arrangement could be based on the hierarchy of foods I like to eat versus foods I despise, it is completely up to me. Those decisions are made online using **HTML**.
